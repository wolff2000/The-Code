<h2>What's wrong with Star Trek?</h2>
<p>Well, first of all, Star Trek is gay. Perhaps the problem stems from the fact that it is just too old, whereas Star Wars, though old, contains a more polished touch.</p>
<p>Second of all, Star Trek is a Type 2 civilization. On the Kardashev scale, a type 2 civilization is defined as having 100% control over its star and can harness its energy. Star Wars, however, is a Type 3 civilization, which means that it not only has power over its solar system, but control over the entire galaxy as well.</p>
